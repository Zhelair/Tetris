Nightstand Tetris — The Only Tetris That Knows Too Much
Welcome to Nightstand Tetris, the unofficial remake of the classic game you love — except this version has… personality. Strange events pop out of nowhere. Money appears where it shouldn’t. Trains pass through your screen for dramatic effect. And yes, the level of chaos increases exactly when you don’t expect it. Just like real life.
This project started as a simple “let’s code Tetris” idea and ended up as a full cinematic experience with random events, bonuses, and a suspiciously witty narrator.

🎮 Gameplay
Classic Tetris rules apply:
Rotate, move, and drop tetrominoes.


Clear lines to score points.


Don’t let the blocks reach the top… unless you want to witness philosophical despair.


Starting from Level 7, the game accelerates on purpose — because Tetris is fun until it’s not, so we made the ending quick, punchy, and satisfying.

✨ Features
🌩 Dynamic On-Screen Events
Dozens of random events pop up during the game — bonus messages, mysterious items, dramatic warnings. We respect your chaos, but we organize it… visually.
💸 The Legendary Nightstand Bonus
Find “Euro in the nightstand” and instantly get +300 points.
 Don’t ask why. Don’t ask how. Just enjoy the win.
🎵 Sound & Animation
Smooth animations, satisfying block movement, and polished UI elements.
 No unnecessary drama — only the fun kind.
